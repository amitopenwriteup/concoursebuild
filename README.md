# Concourse Build

This repository demonstrates a sample setup for building and deploying applications using **Concourse CI**. It contains pipeline configuration files, job definitions, and supporting resources to automate continuous integration and delivery workflows.

---

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to showcase how Concourse can be used to:
- Define automated pipelines
- Manage build and test jobs
- Deploy applications in a repeatable and reliable way

*(Structure may vary based on your repo content.)*

---

## Prerequisites

- Concourse CI installed and running (local or remote)
- Docker installed and configured
- Fly CLI configured to interact with your Concourse target

---

## Usage

1. Set your target in Concourse:
   bash
   fly -t tutorial login -c http://localhost:8080 -u test -p test
`

2. Upload and set the pipeline:

   bash
   fly -t tutorial set-pipeline -p my-pipeline -c pipeline.yml
   

3. Unpause the pipeline:

   bash
   fly -t tutorial unpause-pipeline -p my-pipeline
   

4. Trigger the jobs manually or wait for automatic triggers:

   bash
   fly -t tutorial trigger-job -j my-pipeline/job-name

## Next Steps

* Add automated tests into the pipeline
* Push Docker images to a registry
* Extend with Kubernetes deployment
* Integrate notifications (Slack, Email, etc.)
